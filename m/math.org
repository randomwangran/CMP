[Dude：will you come down, and we do some math.](https://youtu.be/9reizHjwuNY?t=113)

I never could image [Newton–Raphson method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) could related to such wonderful mathmatical world.

> This study seeks to forecast the peak time of SARS-CoV-2 cases. We find, under the assumptions of no quaratine intervention, Wuhan reach peak infectiouson March 3, 2020; Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou would each peak infectious in the middle of May.
> Sensitivity analysis shows that reducing half of the number of catchment size and the reproductive number would reduce the magnitude of epidemic by more than 60%, while lengthening the peak to June and duration of the epidemic to August.


*** it looks like this equation
$$
\frac{d \ln x}{d x}=\frac{1}{x}
$$

then:
$$
\frac{d x}{x}=d(\ln x)
$$

finally, you got:
$$
\frac{d N}{N}=d(\ln N)=-\alpha d t
$$

**** but question: can we rewirte it into something like this?

$$
N(t)=N_{0} e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}
$$
